# The Programmer and the Toy Robot: A Comedy of Errors

Once upon a time, there was a programmer named Bob who was notorious for always writing perfect code. His colleagues would often joke that he was like a robot who never made any mistakes.

One day, Bob was working on a particularly complex project that required him to write a lot of code. He had been working for hours and was starting to get tired, but he was determined to finish the project before going home.

As he was typing away, he suddenly realized that he had been staring at the same line of code for several minutes without making any progress. He rubbed his eyes and looked closer at the screen, but the code still didn't make any sense to him.  
 
Feeling frustrated, Bob decided to take a break and get some fresh air. As he was walking outside, he saw a group of kids playing with a toy robot.

Suddenly, an idea struck him. He could program the robot to help him with his project! He excitedly ran over to the kids and asked if he could borrow their robot.
